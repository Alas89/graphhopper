 * 8 bits - turn costs flags (e.g. first bit means 'restriction', other flags may used later to separate car/bike/truck restrictions)
 * 12 bits - costs describing the distance this turn would cost (may be used by shortest path search) 
 * 12 bits - costs describing the time this turn would cost (may be used by fastest path search)
